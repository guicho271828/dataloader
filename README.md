# open-source-template

This is a template for open sourcing a project source code in Github.

CONTRIBUTING.md is used to display a notice when a third party contributor
submits a pull request. This tells the contributor to add a sign-off message
to his/her commit message in order to get the commit merged.

PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md also contains the notice.

legal/ contains the Developer Certificate of Origin v1.1,
as well as a copy of GPLv3 and LGPLv3.

src/ contains a sample source code which shows a header that is regarded as a
license notice. [not confirmed by the lawyer yet]
